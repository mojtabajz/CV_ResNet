# ResNet and CNN Model Implementation on CIFAR-10 and Fashion-MNIST Datasets
In this project, I explored the ResNet architecture by implementing ResNet18 and ResNet32, testing their performance on the Fashion-MNIST and CIFAR-10 datasets. I experimented with various parameters and achieved improved accuracy with ResNet32.

In the second part of the project, I developed a simple MLP model with multiple hidden layers, which yielded a 50% accuracy on CIFAR-10, indicating its inadequacy for this dataset. I then implemented a CNN model, improving accuracy to 69%. Finally, I applied ResNet18, which, despite its deeper architecture, resulted in a lower accuracy of 36%, possibly due to the architectural complexity and the dataset's smaller image size (32x32) compared to the original ImageNet dataset for which ResNet was designed.

This project demonstrated the importance of model architecture selection and dataset compatibility, suggesting that further tuning and the use of different optimizers could improve performance.
